Project Documentation: Modular Clicker Template

1. Architecture Overview
	This project uses a Composition over Inheritance architecture.
		* Data: Defined in Godot Resource files (.tres). We do not hardcode values in scripts.
		* Logic: Broken into small, reusable Node components.
		* Communication: Systems communicate via Signal Bus or global Manager classes (Autoloads).
		* Type Safety: Enums are used strictly for Currencies and Stats to prevent string-typing errors.

2. Global Systems (Autoloads)
	These scripts must be enabled in Project Settings -> Autoload.
	Name,			Script Path,								Description
	Bank,			res://core/systems/BankSystem.gd,			Holds the current amount of every currency. Handles transactions (add/spend).
	GameStats,		res://core/systems/GameStats.gd,			Calculates the current value of a stat (e.g., Click Power) based on Upgrade Levels.
	UpgradeManager,	res://core/systems/UpgradeManager.gd,		Manages the purchase logic and tracks the current Level (int) of every stat.
	GameEnums,		res://core/globals/GameEnums.gd,			Central file containing all Enum definitions (CurrencyType, StatType).
	
3. Data Structures (Enums)
	Located in res://core/globals/GameEnums.gd.

	CurrencyType:
		* GOLD
		* MANA
		* DIAMOND

	StatType:
		* CLICK_POWER (How much currency obtained per click)
		* AUTO_MINER_SPEED (How fast auto-generators work)
		* CRIT_CHANCE (Probability of double yield)

4. Resource Types (The "Assets")
	CurrencyDefinition
		Purpose: Defines a valid currency.
		Script: res://core/resources/CurrencyDefinition.gd
		
	Variables:
		* type (Enum): Which currency logic to use.
		* initial_amount: Starting wallet balance.
		* max_amount: Cap limit.

	StatDefinition
		Purpose: Defines a base attribute of the game.
		Script: res://core/resources/StatDefinition.gd
		Variables:
			* stat_type (Enum): Identity of the stat.
			* base_value: The starting value (Level 0 value).

	LevelableUpgrade
		Purpose: Defines the math for buying levels and increasing stats.
		Script: res://core/resources/LevelableUpgrade.gd
		Variables:
			* target_stat (Enum): Which stat this upgrades.
			* cost_currency (Enum): What you pay with.
			* base_cost & cost_growth: Cost formula ($Base \times Growth^{Level}$).
			* power_per_level & mult_per_level: Effect formula.

5. Components (The "Logic Bricks")
	ClickProducer
		Script: res://core/components/ClickProducer.gd
		Usage: Add as a child to a Button or Area2D.
		Function: Generates currency when the parent is clicked.
		Fields:
			currency_type: What to give.
			stat_def: Base stat reference.
			upgrade_def: Reference to the upgrade logic (for scaling math).

	AutoGenerator
		Script: res://core/components/AutoGenerator.gd
		Usage: Add to a scene to generate passive income.
		Function: Ticks every X seconds to generate currency.
		Fields: Similar to ClickProducer, but includes cycle_time.

6. Workflow: Adding Content
	How to add a new "Ruby" Currency:
		Add RUBY to GameEnums.gd.
		Create resource Ruby.tres (CurrencyDefinition).
		Assign RUBY in the resource inspector.
		
	How to create a "Diamond Pickaxe" Upgrade:
		Ensure CLICK_POWER exists in GameEnums.gd.
		Create resource Upgrade_DiamondPick.tres (LevelableUpgrade).
		Set target_stat to CLICK_POWER.
		Set base_cost to 1000 and cost_growth to 1.5.
		Assign this resource to your "Buy Button" UI script.
